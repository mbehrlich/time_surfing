= Time Surfing

== Minimum Viable Product

Timesurfing is an app inspired by couchsurfing, a site that connects hosts and
travelers, so that travelers can stay for free on their couches. Timesurfing
does the same thing, but for time travelers. By the end of Week 9, this app
will, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free
navigation, adequate seed data and sufficient CSS styling:

* Hosting on Heroku
* New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
* Spots (Places to couchsurf)
* Bookings
* Spots search (by location & availability) & Google Maps on search
* Reviews (referred to as references)
* Production README
