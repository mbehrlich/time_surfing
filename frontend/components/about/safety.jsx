    <h3>Do's and Dont's of time travel</h3>
    <p>Time travel can be a fun and interesting experience, but much like any other type of recreation, it can have dangers as well. Follow these helpful tips to help ensure a fun, safe experience.</p>
    <h3>The Butterfly Effect</h3>
    <p>The Butterfly Effect is a term coined by American mathematician, Edward Lorenz, to describe the phenomena whereby an event even as small as the flapping of a butterfly's wings can have incalculable effects on the world at large, and the effects get larger as time goes on.</p>
    <p>For instance, let us suppose that in 1801, a butterfly is flapping its wings normally. A time traveler walks by and forces the butterfly to make a slight course correction. This probably won't have any immediate effects on world history. Things might be the same in 1802 or 1803, but as time goes on the effects would compound and become larger and larger. By the time we got to present day, we could have King Hitler. Do you want King Hitler? Because that's how you get King Hitler.</p>
    <p>In short, no matter what you do, or where you go, <strong>DO NOT MESS WITH BUTTERFLIES</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Avoid Romantic Entanglements</h3>
    <p>This is a big one. Let's say that you're visiting the 30's when you meet a beautiful pacifist. You fall in love and save her life when a car nearly runs her over. But wait, her pacifism results in the United States staying out of World War II, and bam, you've got King Hitler again. You would not believe how nearly every change to the timeline you can imagine leads to King Hitler.</p>
    <p>Think it can't happen to you? Well, it happened to Doctor McCoy in the City on the Edge of Forever, widely considered the best episode of Star Trek ever. </p>
    <p>In short, avoid romantic entanglements in the past, nine out of ten times it results in you becoming your own grandfather anyway, and believe me, you <em>do not</em> want to be your own grandfather.</p>
    <p>By the way, this only refers to the past. If you're in the future, feel free to go nuts.</p>
    <h3>Do not attempt to "It's a Wonderful Life" yourself</h3>
    <p>In the movie "It's a Wonderful Life", George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart, in a fit of depression declares aloud that he wishes he was never born. An angel decides to show him what his town would be like if he was never born, and he realizes what a profound and beneficial effect he has had on every life he has touched.</p>
    <p>If you are wondering what life would be like if you were never born, leave it alone. Most people who try are very disappointed with how little they have affected the world. It's called the Butterfly Effect for a reason, and let's face it, you're no butterfly.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, Timesurfing.com cannot be held financially responsible if through your actions, you accidentally erase your own existence.</p>
