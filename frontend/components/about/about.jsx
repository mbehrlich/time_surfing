    <h3>About Timesurfing</h3>
    <p>Timesurfing is a parody inspired by <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing</a>, where you can find hosts and host guests for free. Timesurfing is coded by me, Matt Ehrlich, as a demonstration of my skills while I am looking for a developer job. The backend is coded using Ruby on Rails, with postgresql for the database. The frontend uses React and Redux as a javascript framework. The project couldn't be done without using google apis, particularly, google maps, google places, and google autocomplete.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for a frontend or fullstack engineer who has experience with Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, Redux, googleapis, HTML5, CSS3, and a little Node, Express, Angular, and MongoDB experience, please contact me. My github username is <a href="https://github.com/mbehrlich">mbehrlich</a>, my linkedin profile is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-ehrlich-784b4777">here</a>, and my email is mattehrlich86@gmail.com. Thanks for taking a look!</p>
