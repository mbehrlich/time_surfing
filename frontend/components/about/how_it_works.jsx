    <p>Time travel is made possible by the <em>Flux Capacitor</em>. This device requires 1.21 jigowatts of electricity and requires the time traveler to be traveling at speeds of at least 88 miles per hour. In the event that your flux capacitor is damaged during your journey, the antenna can be patched together with a few sticks of gum.</p>
